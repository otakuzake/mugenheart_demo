### 🎬 Encounter

The emergency staircase of the mixed-use building was a quiet space, cut off from the daytime hustle and bustle.
When I stepped out onto the stairs to get some fresh air, there was a man there.

He was leaning against the handrail, looking up at the sky.
The orange light of dusk softly illuminated his profile.

Suddenly, he turned toward me.
His interested eyes met mine, and he smiled a bit shyly but with curiosity as he approached.

He kept a slight distance but spoke naturally.
